                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>"Fallen Angels" is a visually stunning and emotionally charged film set in the nocturnal underbelly of Hong Kong. This film, often regarded as an informal sequel to Wong's previous work, "Chungking Express," weaves two disparate tales of love, loss, and loneliness in the bustling city. The first story revolves around a hitman, trying to navigate the loneliness of his profession and his relationship with his partner, who is secretly in love with him. The second narrative follows a mute ex-convict who becomes involved in a bittersweet relationship with a woman from the underworld. "Fallen Angels" is celebrated for its unique visual style, characterized by neon-drenched cinematography, wide-angle lenses, and an unconventional narrative structure. Wong's exploration of urban alienation and the search for connection in a disconnected world is both poetic and deeply resonant. The filmâ€™s atmospheric soundtrack complements its moody visuals, creating a mesmerizing portrait of the city and its night-time denizens.</p>

                <h3>Personal Thoughts</h3>
                <p>"Fallen Angels" really struck a chord with me, especially with its darker themes which I found super relatable. Wong Kar-wai's style is so distinct and immersive that I got totally lost in the film. I even cried twice while watching it, which says a lot. It's a special movie for me, kind of like a mirror reflecting parts of my own life.</p>
